# p4-ts

Typed TypeScript helpers for working with the Perforce `p4` CLI.

The published package name is `p4client-ts`.

## Scope

`p4-ts` is intended to be a preview-first foundation for custom P4 tooling, with opt-in mutating sync support.

In scope:
- Inspect current P4 environment and workspace state
- List local or relevant workspaces
- Inspect pending changelists and opened files
- Preview reconcile operations
- Preview sync operations and apply sync when the caller explicitly opts in
- Read file metadata and depot/local path mappings

Out of scope:
- `submit`
- `shelve` or `unshelve`
- `edit`, `add`, `delete`, or other checkout/open-for-edit flows
- `revert`, `lock`, `unlock`, `move`, `integrate`, or `resolve`
- Changelist creation or mutation
- Client, stream, or other spec mutation
- Server administration or any workflow that mutates server-side state

`sync()` is the only mutating workflow currently exposed, and the recommended pattern is still `previewSync()` first, then `sync()`.
